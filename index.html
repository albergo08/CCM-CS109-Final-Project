<h4>
<a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h4>

<p>eBay is one of the largest online markets for individual transactions outside of multi-person companies. One of those individuals interacting with this virtual marketplace is Michael’s mother, and she’d like to use it better! Judging from the variety and ostensible randomness of the type and structure of people’s product listings, it is clear that few people approach their listing with a strategy that is more complex than just picking a starting bid price. In fact, there are a seemingly endless number of factors that a user has control over when making a listing that can potentially influence the bidder/buyer. We would like to explore what those factors are - from seller feedback info, number of pictures, etc - and see what combination of them is best to make a successful auction. </p>

<h4>
<a id="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h4>

<p>Our initial goal was to determine what factors a seller could use in creating the auction to increase the chances of successfully selling the item and maximizing profit. However, this goal changed as we worked on the project. We were able to determine some indicators of what influences an auction's success rate, but instead of predicting how accurate these indicators are for determining success rate, we decided to shift gears and predict whether it would be more profitable to sell items on eBay or if it was more profitable to sell the item to other sources (such as Apple, AT&amp;T, Verizon, etc.). </p>

<a id="data-gathering-and-cleaning" class="anchor" href="#data-gathering-and-cleaning" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Gathering and Cleaning</h4>

<p>Using eBay's API, we gathered data on completed auctions and the auction's seller's profile information. eBay has a huge database, so we specified that the only auctions we were going to focus on were ones that were selling iPhone 5s phones with 32GB. We also made sure to clean our data to only get values that we thought were useful. For example, information about the different bidders wasn't relevant information to us, because from a seller's perspective, they would have no control over the types of bidders that bid on their auction. </p>
